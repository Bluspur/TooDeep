Submission to my first game jam. Given the time sensitive nature of the project, this contains some unideal code, especially in the rather large movement script that handles player state. However, it does hold up rather well in game, and allow the player some more complicated behaviour than your typical platformer. Obviously sound is absent from the project, as none of us were profficient in SFX and it was pushed back and back until the end. Ultimately the result was good. It would have benefitted from sound, but the game is a fun movement platformer.
